    <h1>🥐 Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,
      named for its historical crescent shape. Croissants and other viennoiserie
      are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with
      butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a
      sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered,
      flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry. We are making and baking our
      almond and plain croissant daily.
